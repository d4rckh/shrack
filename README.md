# SHRACK
*ðŸš€ Fast hash brute forcer*

Shrack is a very fast python coded hash brute forcer. It can brute force: md5 and sha256 types. I hope, with the help of the community, we will make this project better

**Requirements**: python3

# Example Usage
```bash
$ python3 shrack.py --type md5 --string 2dccd1ab3e03990aea77359831c85ca2 --wordlist wordlist.txt
```
Using the `type` argument we provide the hash type, it can be at the moment md5 or sha256

Using the `string` argument we provide the hash that we need to crack

Using the `wordlist` argument we provide the wordlist we will use to brute force the hash that was provided in the `string` argument
